## Purpose
To ensure the accuracy and precision of laboratory test results through systematic quality control monitoring.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all quantitative tests performed in the clinical laboratory.

## Responsibilities
- Medical Technologists: Perform daily QC
- QC Coordinator: Review QC data and trends
- Laboratory Director: Approve corrective actions

## Procedure

### Daily QC Protocol
1. Run two levels of control for each analyte
2. Enter results into LIS
3. Verify results are within acceptable limits
4. Document any corrective actions

### Westgard Rules Application
- **1-3s**: Reject when control exceeds ±3SD
- **2-2s**: Reject when 2 consecutive controls exceed ±2SD on same side
- **R-4s**: Reject when range between controls exceeds 4SD
- **4-1s**: Reject when 4 consecutive controls exceed ±1SD on same side
- **10x**: Warning when 10 consecutive controls are on same side of mean

### Corrective Actions
1. Repeat control
2. If still fails, prepare fresh control
3. If still fails, recalibrate instrument
